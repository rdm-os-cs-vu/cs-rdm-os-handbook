Through the OSCAWARDS, open science in Amsterdam is highlighted. All groups and projects with open science related aspects or challenges can be nominated for the awards. 

A project by Shuai Wang, Ronald Siebes, Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Tobias Kuhn, a bachelor student Navroop K Singh, together with colleagues from the Open Science team in the university library won the Open Science Community Amsterdam Awards (OSCA). They received a grant of 400 euros. In the project, they studied the use of FAIR Implementation Profiles for making suggestions while researchers write their Data Management Plans.  

The paper has been accepted for publication at the MTSR conference. A preprint is available [here](https://shuai.ai/static/files/paper/mtsr-fip2dmp.pdf).
